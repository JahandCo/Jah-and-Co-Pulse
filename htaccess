**Placeholders for Mail and Pulse:**
For now, you can leave the `/mail/` and `/pulse/` directories empty. In our next step, we will move the full application code into `index.php` files inside these folders. Trying to access `/mail` or `/pulse` will currently show a "404 Not Found" error, which is expected.
